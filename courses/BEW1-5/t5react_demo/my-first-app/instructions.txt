React uses a Component Architecture. Notice how one component can 
contain another component and the App is built from many components 
each designed to display a single UI element.

A route is an address that appears in the address bar of the browser.

To work with React Router it helps to understand some terminology.

Router - A parent component that manages Routes
Route - A component that displays another component
